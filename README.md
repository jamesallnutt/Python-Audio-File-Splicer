# Python-Audio-Choppin
A Python Program to Chop Audio Files into User Defined Segments and rename with date + time start hex. 

REQUIRED FOR OPERATION:

This utilises FFMPEG to carry out any audio manipulation and as such you will need to add FFMPEG to your repository. Due to file size limits I have not uploaded this here. 

FFMPEG Can be downloaded here: https://www.ffmpeg.org/download.html

The File ffmpeg.exe should then be inserted at ~/ffmpeg/bin/ffmpeg.exe

See main.py if you would like to edit the save location of the above.

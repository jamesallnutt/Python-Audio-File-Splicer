# Python-Audio-Choppin
This is a Python Program to cut Audio Files into User Defined Segments and rename with user inputted filename + date + time start hex. 

**Prerequisites for use:

*Python Modules:

- threading
- queue
- subprocess
- tkinter
- os
- sys
- time

**REQUIRED FOR OPERATION:

This utilises FFMPEG to carry out any audio manipulation and as such you will need to add FFMPEG to your repository. Due to file size limits I have not uploaded this here. 

FFMPEG Can be downloaded here: https://www.ffmpeg.org/download.html

**Windows:

The File ffmpeg.exe should then be inserted at ~/ffmpeg/bin/ffmpeg.exe

See main.py if you would like to edit the save location of the above. 

For Mac Users, same as above, but use the Mac version of ffmpeg.
